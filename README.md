The peer assessment dataset was used in our paper, **SC-PA: A Spot-checking Model Based on Stackelberg Game Theory for Improving Peer Assessment**.

## Background and Source

The synthetic dataset used in the experiment is generated based on the scenario where 1,000 students submit 1,000 submissions to an assignment before they participating in a spot-checking based peer assessment activity. Adhering to the suggested settings in (Wang et al., 2018$^{[1]}$), students' review reliabilities are set following a Gaussian distribution ![img](F:\a笔记\paper\毕业大论文\DataSet\SC-PA-synthetic-dataset\README.assets\wps5.jpg), where ![img](F:\a笔记\paper\毕业大论文\DataSet\SC-PA-synthetic-dataset\README.assets\wps6.jpg) and ![img](F:\a笔记\paper\毕业大论文\DataSet\SC-PA-synthetic-dataset\README.assets\wps7.jpg).
